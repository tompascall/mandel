The <code>BigDecimal</code> class implements immutable
arbitrary-precision decimal numbers.  The methods of the
<code>BigDecimal</code> class provide operations for fixed and
floating point arithmetic, comparison, format conversions, and
hashing.
<p>
As the numbers are decimal, there is an exact correspondence between
an instance of a <code>BigDecimal</code> object and its
<code>String</code> representation; the <code>BigDecimal</code> class
provides direct conversions to and from <code>String</code> and
character array (<code>char[]</code>) objects, as well as conversions
to and from the Java primitive types (which may not be exact) and
<code>BigInteger</code>.
<p>
In the descriptions of constructors and methods in this documentation,
the value of a <code>BigDecimal</code> number object is shown as the
result of invoking the <code>toString()</code> method on the object.
The internal representation of a decimal number is neither defined
nor exposed, and is not permitted to affect the result of any
operation.
<p>
The floating point arithmetic provided by this class is defined by
the ANSI X3.274-1996 standard, and is also documented at
<code>http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal</code>

<h3>Operator methods</h3>
<p>
Operations on <code>BigDecimal</code> numbers are controlled by a
{@link MathContext} object, which provides the context (precision and
other information) for the operation. Methods that can take a
<code>MathContext</code> parameter implement the standard arithmetic
operators for <code>BigDecimal</code> objects and are known as
<i>operator methods</i>.  The default settings provided by the
constant {@link MathContext#DEFAULT} (<code>digits=9,
form=SCIENTIFIC, lostDigits=false, roundingMode=ROUND_HALF_UP</code>)
perform general-purpose floating point arithmetic to nine digits of
precision.  The <code>MathContext</code> parameter must not be
<code>null</code>.
<p>
Each operator method also has a version provided which does
not take a <code>MathContext</code> parameter.  For this version of
each method, the context settings used are <code>digits=0,
form=PLAIN, lostDigits=false, roundingMode=ROUND_HALF_UP</code>;
these settings perform fixed point arithmetic with unlimited
precision, as defined for the original BigDecimal class in Java 1.1
and Java 1.2.
<p>
For monadic operators, only the optional <code>MathContext</code>
parameter is present; the operation acts upon the current object.
<p>
For dyadic operators, a <code>BigDecimal</code> parameter is always
present; it must not be <code>null</code>.
The operation acts with the current object being the left-hand operand
and the <code>BigDecimal</code> parameter being the right-hand operand.
<p>
For example, adding two <code>BigDecimal</code> objects referred to
by the names <code>award</code> and <code>extra</code> could be
written as any of:
<p><code>
    award.add(extra)
<br>award.add(extra, MathContext.DEFAULT)
<br>award.add(extra, acontext)
</code>
<p>
(where <code>acontext</code> is a <code>MathContext</code> object),
which would return a <code>BigDecimal</code> object whose value is
the result of adding <code>award</code> and <code>extra</code> under
the appropriate context settings.
<p>
When a <code>BigDecimal</code> operator method is used, a set of
rules define what the result will be (and, by implication, how the
result would be represented as a character string).
These rules are defined in the BigDecimal arithmetic documentation
(see the URL above), but in summary:
<ul>
<li>Results are normally calculated with up to some maximum number of
significant digits.
For example, if the <code>MathContext</code> parameter for an operation
were <code>MathContext.DEFAULT</code> then the result would be
rounded to 9 digits; the division of 2 by 3 would then result in
0.666666667.
<br>
You can change the default of 9 significant digits by providing the
method with a suitable <code>MathContext</code> object. This lets you
calculate using as many digits as you need -- thousands, if necessary.
Fixed point (scaled) arithmetic is indicated by using a
<code>digits</code> setting of 0 (or omitting the
<code>MathContext</code> parameter).
<br>
Similarly, you can change the algorithm used for rounding from the
default "classic" algorithm.
<li>
In standard arithmetic (that is, when the <code>form</code> setting
is not <code>PLAIN</code>), a zero result is always expressed as the
single digit <code>'0'</code> (that is, with no sign, decimal point,
or exponent part).
<li>
Except for the division and power operators in standard arithmetic,
trailing zeros are preserved (this is in contrast to binary floating
point operations and most electronic calculators, which lose the
information about trailing zeros in the fractional part of results).
<br>
So, for example:
<p><code>
    new BigDecimal("2.40").add(     new BigDecimal("2"))      =&gt; "4.40"
<br>new BigDecimal("2.40").subtract(new BigDecimal("2"))      =&gt; "0.40"
<br>new BigDecimal("2.40").multiply(new BigDecimal("2"))      =&gt; "4.80"
<br>new BigDecimal("2.40").divide(  new BigDecimal("2"), def) =&gt; "1.2"
</code>
<p>where the value on the right of the <code>=&gt;</code> would be the
result of the operation, expressed as a <code>String</code>, and
<code>def</code> (in this and following examples) refers to
<code>MathContext.DEFAULT</code>).
This preservation of trailing zeros is desirable for most
calculations (including financial calculations).
If necessary, trailing zeros may be easily removed using division by 1.
<li>
In standard arithmetic, exponential form is used for a result
depending on its value and the current setting of <code>digits</code>
(the default is 9 digits).
If the number of places needed before the decimal point exceeds the
<code>digits</code> setting, or the absolute value of the number is
less than <code>0.000001</code>, then the number will be expressed in
exponential notation; thus
<p><code>
  new BigDecimal("1e+6").multiply(new BigDecimal("1e+6"), def)
</code>
<p>results in <code>1E+12</code> instead of
<code>1000000000000</code>, and
<p><code>
  new BigDecimal("1").divide(new BigDecimal("3E+10"), def)
</code>
<p>results in <code>3.33333333E-11</code> instead of
<code>0.0000000000333333333</code>.
<p>
The form of the exponential notation (scientific or engineering) is
determined by the <code>form</code> setting.
<eul>
<p>
The names of methods in this class follow the conventions established
by <code>java.lang.Number</code>, <code>java.math.BigInteger</code>,
and <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> in Java 1.1 and Java 1.2.
